# This simple eCommerce application is developed as part of Upshift's technical interview.

## Most of the recommended libraries are used in this application: Formik, Axios, React-Router. Additionally, for the purposes of this challenge, I used Typescript and I relied on React's built-in state management tools like useState and useEffect for managing local component-level state and handling component lifecycle-related side effects. 

## For the design, which is responsive and similar to the given one in the challenge, I used only html and css, no third-party UI kit. 

### On http://localhost:3000, initially you will se the listed products fetched from the given API. Clicking on one of them, on the right side of the screen you will se preview of the particular product (a dialog will appear on mobile screens). You can sort the products by name (title) and price, simply by clicking the appropriate buttons visible on the page. Additionally by clicking the "Add product" button, a dialog will appear through which a new product can be created (there's the specified and required validation). After successfully creating a new product, it will be visible and listed with together with the other products.
